\section{Classical parking functions}

Imagine $n$ cars drive down a one-way street with $n$ spots. Each car has a favourite parking spot given by $\pi:[n] \to [n]$. In order, the cars try to park: trying their favourite spot, or the next open spot. $\pi$ is a \emph{parking function} if all cars park.

    \label{fig:parking-procedure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Enumeration}

Of the $n^n$ possible preference functions for $n$ cars, how many are parking functions? $(n + 1)^{n - 1}$ (magical!) Its circular symmetry proof is even more so!

Is there magic to be found in other questions about parking?

\section{A framework for variants}%

There are many variants of the parking function problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item What if there are more cars than spots? (\cite{cameron-johannsen-prellberg-schweitzer-2008})
\item What if spots can fit multiple cars? (\cite{blake-konheim-1977})
\item The elusive \emph{prime parking functions}
\end{itemize}

These problems can all be modeled by a \emph{preference-restricted parking function} --- a parking function with $\pi([n]) \subset S \subset [n]$.

We can use our intuition for parking functions to solve other parking problems!

\section{$[s]$-restricted parking functions}

Parking functions with $n > s$ cars and $s$ spots are exactly $[s]$-restricted parking functions! Just imagine or remove the last $n - s$ slots. 

There are two ways to count $[s]$-restricted parking functions.

Either start with all preference functions $[c] \to [s]$ and subtract all those where $i$ is the first spot left empty ---
\[
	s^{n} - \sum_{i = 0}^{s - 1} \binom{n}{i} (i + 1)^{i - 1} (s - i - 1)^{n - i}.
\]

Or, start with all parking functions and sieve out those where cars prefer spots in $[c] \setminus [s]$ ---
\[
	\sum_{i = s}^{n} \binom{n}{i} (i + 1)^{i - 1} (s - i - 1)^{n - i}.
\]

To sieve, we color the cars in a parking function red or indigo according to certain rules. A valid coloring has $i$ indigo cars with preferences forming a parking function and the remaining red cars preferring \emph{forbidden spots} in $[i + 1] \setminus [s]$.

Every parking function has equally many colorings with even $i$ and odd $i$, except $[s]$-restricted parking functions --- else we can flip the color of a car with maximum preference.

For $n=5$, $s = 2$, the two colorings of $\pi = (1,3,2,2,4)$ with $i = 3$ are connected by recoloring car 5.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\mzncar[(0,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(3,0)]{red}{red} \mzncar[(6,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(9,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(12,0)]{red}{red}
\end{tikzpicture} $\quad \longleftrightarrow \quad$
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\mzncar[(18,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(21,0)]{red}{red} \mzncar[(24,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(27,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(30,0)]{blue}{blue}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For $s = 4$, however, there is exactly one valid coloring ---

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\mzncar[(0,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(3,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(6,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(9,0)]{blue}{blue} \mzncar[(12,0)]{blue}{blue}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Counting colorings with $i \equiv n \pmod 2$ positively, the rest negatively, everything cancels but the $[s]$-restricted parking functions! 

Our two counts are connected by Abel's generalization of the binomial theorem. We can recover Abel's binomial theorem from the enumerator for cars preferring the first spot!
\begin{align*}
	(x + y + n)^{n} & = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{i} x (x + i)^{i - 1} (y + n - i)^{n - i} \\
			& \Updownarrow \\
	(s - 1 + x)^{n} & = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{i} x (x + i)^{i - 1} (s - 1 - i)^{n - i}
\end{align*}

\section{Other restrictions}

\subsection{Modular restrictions}

If $s$ spots can each hold $g$ cars, then we can think about $S$-restricted parking functions for $S = \{ i \in [c] \mid i \equiv 1 \pmod g \}$! \cite{blake-konheim-1977} used complex analysis and generating functions to show that there are $s^{gs - 2}$ ways to park $gs - 1$ cars in this set up. We used a circle argument and $S$-restricted parking functions to give a much simpler proof!

\subsection{Prime parking functions}

Some parking functions can be ``factored'', partitioning the street into intervals on which the preferences form parking functions themselves! The irreducible ones are called ``prime''.

Prime parking functions also have an elegant enumeration and are worth a closer look. They're in bijection with $S$-restricted parking functions for $S = [c]\backslash\{2\}$! The trick is a reshuffling of parking spots: shift all your preferences $n>1$ to $n+1>2.$
