\section{Classical parking functions}

Imagine $n$ cars drive down a one-way street with $n$ spots. Each car has a favourite parking spot given by $\pi:[n] \to [n]$. In order, the cars try to park: trying their favourite spot, or the next open spot. $\pi$ is a \emph{parking function} if all cars park.

    \label{fig:parking-procedure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Enumeration}

Of the $n^n$ possible preference functions for $n$ cars, how many are parking functions? $(n + 1)^{n - 1}$ (magical!) Its circular symmetry proof is even more so!

Is there more magic to be found in questions about parking?

\section{A framework for variants}%

A couple variant problems, some from the literature:
\begin{itemize}
\item What if there are more cars than spots? (\cite{cameron-johannsen-prellberg-schweitzer-2008})
\item What if spots can fit multiple cars? (\cite{blake-konheim-1977})
\item What if all the parking functions have to be prime?
\end{itemize}

These problems can all be modeled by a \emph{preference-restricted parking function}. An $S$-restricted parking function $\pi$ on $[c]$ is a parking function with $\pi([c]) \subset S \subset [c]$.

\section{$[s]$-restricted parking functions}

Parking functions with $c > s$ cars and $s$ spots are exactly $[s]$-restricted parking functions! All spots will be filled if and only if there are no unfilled spots in the first $s$.

\subsection{Enumeration and Abel's theorem}

How to count? One way: start with all preference functions $[c] \to [s]$ and subtract all those where spots are left empty ---
\[
	s^{c} - \sum_{i = 0}^{s - 1} \binom{c}{i} (i + 1)^{i - 1} (s - i - 1)^{c - i}.
\]

Or, start with all parking functions and sieve out those where cars prefer spots in $[c] \setminus [s]$ ---
\[
	\sum_{i = s}^{c} \binom{c}{i} (i + 1)^{i - 1} (s - i - 1)^{c - i}.
\]

To show this, consider parking functions with cars colored red and indigo, where the $i$ indigo cars form a parking function of length $i$ and the remaining red cars prefer the ``forbidden" spots in $[s]\backslash [i]$:

An involution 

Abel's generalization of the binomial theorem connects these with the formula, which can be recovered from parking functions:
\[
	(x + y + n)^{n} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{i} x (x + i)^{i - 1} (y + n - i)^{n - i}.
\]

\section{Other restrictions}

If $s$ spots can each hold $g$ cars, then we can think about $S$-restricted parking functions for $S = \{ i \in [c] \mid i \equiv 1 \pmod g \}$! \cite{blake-konheim-1977} used complex analysis and generating functions to show that there are $s^{gs - 2}$ ways to park $gs - 1$ cars in this set up. We used a circle argument to give a much simpler proof!

Prime parking functions are in bijection with $S$-restricted parking functions for $S = [c]\backslash\{2\}$! Just ``shift cars over spot 2''.

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parking functions are based on the analysis of preferences and have elegant combinatorics.
    \item Restricting the outputs of parking functions provides a powerful framework to look at variant problems.
\end{itemize}
