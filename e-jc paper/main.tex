		We demonstrate constructive procedures to enumerate restricted parking functions --- parking functions of length $c$ such that all cars prefer one of the first $s$ spots (among other similar restrictions on cars' preferences). We describe the utility of these procedures in sampling from defect $d$ preference lists.
