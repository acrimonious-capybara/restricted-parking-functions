\section{Introduction}
% Note that we're not labeling sections because you shouldn't be
% doing a lot of referring back and forth in your poster---let the
% interested folks read your thesis or Clinic report, or ask
% questions.

To analyze functions, we often restrict them. By restricting parking functions, we understand variants that other parking functions are built from and are intrinsically interesting too!

\section{Parking functions}%

$c$ cars drive down a one-way street with $c$ spots. Each car has a preferred parking spot given by $\pi:[c] \to [c]$. In order, the cars try to park: first trying their preference, then going to the first open spot. $\pi$ is a \emph{parking function} if all cars can park.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{The parking procedure for preferences given by $\pi = (2, 1, 2, 2)$}
    \label{fig:parking-procedure}
\end{figure}

A \emph{breakpoint} in a parking function is a spot at which only one car attempts to park. The final spot $c$ is always a breakpoint; we call a parking function \emph{prime} if this is the only breakpoint.

\subsection{Enumeration}

Of the $c^c$ possible preference functions for $c$ cars, how many are parking functions? The answer is $(c+1)^{c-1}$ (elegant!)
\begin{itemize}
\item Take $c$ cars in a circular lot with $c+1$ spots; $(c+1)^c$ total
\item Removing the empty spot gives $c$ parked cars in a line
\item This is a parking function! Each $\pi$ is mapped to by $c+1$ preference functions. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Encapsulating variants}%

A couple variant problems, some from the literature:
\begin{itemize}
\item What if there are more cars than spots? (\cite{cameron-johannsen-prellberg-schweitzer-2008})
\item What if spots can fit multiple cars? (\cite{blake-konheim-1977})
\item What if all the parking functions have to be prime?
\end{itemize}

These problems can all be modeled by a \emph{preference-restricted parking function}. An $S$-restricted parking function $\pi$ on $[c]$ is a parking function with $\pi([c]) \subset S \subset [c]$.

\section{$[s]$-restricted parking functions}

Parking functions with $c > s$ cars and $s$ spots are exactly $[s]$-restricted parking functions! All spots will be filled if and only if there are no unfilled spots in the first $s$.

\subsection{Enumeration and Abel's theorem}

How to count? Two restrictions, so two techniques! 

Start with all preference functions $[c] \to [s]$ and subtract all those where spots are left empty ---
\[
	s^{c} - \sum_{i = 0}^{s - 1} \binom{c}{i} (i + 1)^{i - 1} (s - i - 1)^{c - i}.
\]

Or, start with all parking functions and sieve out those where cars prefer spots in $[c] \setminus [s]$ ---
\[
	\sum_{i = s}^{c} \binom{c}{i} (i + 1)^{i - 1} (s - i - 1)^{c - i}.
\]

Abel's generalization of the binomial theorem connects these with the formula, which can be recovered from parking functions:
\[
	(x + y + n)^{n} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{i} x (x + i)^{i - 1} (y + n - i)^{n - i}.
\]

\section{Other restrictions}

If $s$ spots can each hold $g$ cars, then we can think about $S$-restricted parking functions for $S = \{ i \in [c] \mid i \equiv 1 \pmod g \}$! \cite{blake-konheim-1977} used complex analysis and generating functions to show that there are $s^{gs - 2}$ ways to park $gs - 1$ cars in this set up. We used a circle argument to give a much simpler proof!

Prime parking functions are in bijection with $S$-restricted parking functions for $S = [c]\backslash\{2\}$! Just ``shift cars over spot 2''.

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parking functions are based on the analysis of preferences and have elegant combinatorics.
    \item Restricting the outputs of parking functions provides a powerful framework to look at variant problems.
\end{itemize}
